Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. Home Credit, a company dedicated to broadening financial inclusion and providing lines of credit & loans to the unbanked population, wants to predict their clients' repayment abilities which will ensure clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful. *The goal of the project is to help Home Credit to predict whether a client will repay a loan using various statistical and machine learning methods by analysing a variety of alternative data.* The project would be split into three parts: 

- **Exploratory Data Analysis.** In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we are going to do the basic data cleaning work and calculate statistics, make figures to find trends, anomalies, NAs, patterns, or relationships within the data. 

- **Feature Engineering.** In this part, we are going to construct our feature: adding new features from the existing data; selecting only the most important features. Combination of different datasets by SQL can be viable in order to create new features from the train & test dataset.

- **Model Construction and Selection.** In this part, we are going to use several machine learning models e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Boosting, Support Vector Machine. For model selection, we will use ROC & AUC metrics to evaluate the model.
